# Task: For this exercise, take each user-provided certificate (from the Citizenâ€™s Card, XCA, downloaded,
# etc.) and recreate its validation chain in a list. To make the chain, load the user certificate, a dictionary of
# user-specified intermediate roots, and the roots.
# You should stop when you get a root certificate (i.e., self-signed). The root certificate can be missing from
# that list. That usually means the root certificate is already in your trusted certificates. Otherwise, the chain
# will be untrusted unless you already trust the user or intermediate certificates.
# HINT: Remember that the user and root certificates are loaded into a dictionary with the subject as the key.
# Therefore, it is simple to obtain the issuer of a certificate.
